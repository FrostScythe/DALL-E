## Getting Started

To explore and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. Open two separate terminals within Visual Studio Code:

   In one terminal, navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

   In the other terminal, navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies in both directories:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Create an `.env` file in the server directory to securely store your secret keys and configurations:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
   MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv:your-url"
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
   ```

   Replace placeholders with your actual API keys and URLs.

6. Start the development server in both the client and server directories:

   In the client directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   In the server directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. Your AI Image Generating Website is now accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
